Brighter Together

M&M’s has the same philosophy on both their product and people: they’re all the same inside. Leaning into this simple truth, we found a playful and powerful way to deliver messages of positivity at a time when the world needs them most.

We ran these pieces during culturally relevant moments online, in print, and OOH - when even more eyes would be on these hot-button issues. We even got the opportunity to share our colors in NYC's 2017 and 2018 Pride Parades.

Caramel Launch

In 2017, M&M’s launched a new flavor: Caramel M&M’s. Problem was, the caramel ingredient was kind of old news. So how did we make an old-time, stogy ingredient like a cube of caramel feel fresh and new? We unsquared it.

You can imagine the scrutiny that goes into creating a new spokescandy, and this lovable cube of caramel was no exception. We carefully developed every single detail about him – from his quirky personality, to his slightly-sticky texture, right down to his velcro sneakers – to make sure he was the perfectly imperfect “square." Some people at Mars are still deciding how they feel about him. Namely, Red.

Voiced by comedian David Cross, this square spokescandy is almost as lovable as the new flavor itself.
