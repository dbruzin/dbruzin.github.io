Named one of *CNN's killer startups*, Calle is a street soccer company my friends and I co-founded. The custom ball and apparel have won awards and competitions, and have sold in stores and catalogs worldwide.

Calle is both an 'ownable' brand for the avid soccer player/fan, and a manufacturer of balls, shoes, and apparel made to enjoy taking beatings on the asphalt. It is sold in over 100 stores in the USA, Canada, and Internationally. The marketing is grass-roots with stickers on signs and wheat plaster posters.
